    "The dataset comes from CrowdFlower and contains over 9,000 tweets related to Apple and Google products. Each tweet has been human-labeled for sentiment as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Positive emotion\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Negative emotion\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No emotion toward brand/product\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Unclear/I can’t tell\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Textual Data: Tweets are short, noisy, and often contain slang, hashtags, mentions, and URLs, which makes preprocessing crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Target Variable: The label indicating whether a sentiment is directed at a brand or product.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Class Distribution: The dataset is slightly imbalanced, with more neutral/no-emotion tweets compared to positive or negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is well-suited for the business problem because it directly reflects real customer opinions on social media about Apple and Google. The labeled sentiments provide a foundation for training supervised machine learning models to classify unseen tweets in real time."
